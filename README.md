## My Journey

I started this AI Math Tutor project in **January 2025** with the goal of helping students around the world improve their math skills.  
As an international student in the UK, I faced challenges balancing work, studies, and tuition fees. This motivated me to create a tool that could make learning math easier and more personalized.  



Over the months, I have:  
- Learned and implemented machine learning concepts from scratch  
- Built transformer layers for adaptive learning  
- Collected datasets from multiple sources  
- Developed interactive charts to visualize student performance  

This project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, combining my passion for AI and education.

Note: I got  help from external sources such as chatgtpt, google and so on.


-**working on AI model training**

I chose the Transformer model for this project casue that is model sequence to sequence model which is best suitable for the complex training. 
first when i started this project I have no idea about it. i read book in university libraries, reasearch on google. so that's the first spark lead to another step which is learning the machine learing.  I start from -*fundamentals of Deeplearning by Deeplearning.ai* there i can learn basic principals of deep learning such as -*Notaion, gradiant decent, Logistic Regression,Derrivitives,Computation Graphs,Vectorization and so on*.
after i take some certification courses that are AI and Application and Maintanance by Nvida,microsoft Azure Ai-900. thease are the things are lead to my achivements. then i built my model step by step. first positional encoding, mask creation, layers, and so on.  I spend the time in university holiday with this project however, i hadn't gotten any results for 5 months. I check with change the model architeture and research with gpt. after some day ago. 10 of october. it worked finaly. loss function worked. However, accracy level 0.0000, evaluation rate 12.000 something. after I finetune with change the num_heads, layers, epochs. finaly worked. I created 15 epochs final loss rate. 0.365 and accracy level=0.9810. this is the big achievement in my point of view. because first stage to current stage is not small. that give more happy to me.


-**Collecting Datasets**


I uses the DeepMind Math Datasets, Kaggle Math Datasets, and lot of created by myself by pandas framework. Even i have more datasets, i used 1000 datasets beacause current stage i have a problem on that the problem is if i train with 200,000,400,000 datasets.  i have to put more effort in to the model customization. for instance  i trained the model with 200,000 datasets but  i haven't get  accration predtions or accuracy level even if i used fine tuning. so i planned to  change the strategy that is starting from small to big. so in this concept. i don't need to get more computation power as same as before.
